# Ghostex

macOS Native Ghostty-based desktop app (Not using Electron or Tauri!) for running agent CLIs with persistent terminals, GUI panes, browser panes, notifications, mobile access, and a lightweight code editor.

Ghostex is built for developers who keep multiple agents and terminals alive at once. It combines low-RAM Ghostty terminals, native Swift UI, T3code GUI panes, Chromium CEF browser panes, and Android/iOS session access in one workspace.

## Install

### macOS

The Homebrew cask installs the correct Apple Silicon or Intel Mac build automatically.

```bash
brew trust maddada/tap && brew install --cask maddada/tap/ghostex --force
```

You can also download the latest DMG from GitHub Releases.

> Windows and Linux ports need contributors.

### Android and iOS

Use the mobile apps to connect live to your Ghostex agent CLI sessions. APKs are in Releases. Join discord for iOS app.

<!-- CDXC:AndroidDistribution 2026-06-09-23:55: The public README Android badge must point at the current Ghostex release APK asset so users do not install an older mobile package after a desktop release ships with a matching Android build. -->
